## Key Achievements
- Automated the core functional flows (e.g., user login, product search, adding items to cart).  
- Reduced regression testing time by 50% using Selenium WebDriver.  
- Discovered and documented critical and high-severity bugs that were fixed before production release.  
- Improved test coverage to over 90% by designing comprehensive test cases.
